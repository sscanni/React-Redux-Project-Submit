# "Would You Rather?" Project

## Project Overview

This is my submission for the final assessment project for Udacity's React and Redux course. This is the "Would You Rather?" website that enables the user to play the “Would You Rather?” game. The user is asked a "Would You Rather?" question and the user has two choices to pick from. The user can also create new “Would You Rather?” questions for them and other users to answer. In the app the users will be able to answer questions, see which questions they answered and haven’t answered, and see how other people have voted, post questions, and see the ranking of users on the leaderboard.

## Installation Requirements

The following steps need to be followed:

1) Clone or download project in a directory from Github https://github.com/sscanni/React-Redux-Project

The project was bootstrapped using https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app.
